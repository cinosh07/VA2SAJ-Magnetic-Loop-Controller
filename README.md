**Future Development Features:**<br>
-[Yaesu Radio Cat Control compatible](https://github.com/cinosh07/VA2SAJ-Magnetic-Loop-Controller/issues/1)<br>
-[Kenwood Radio Cat Control compatible](https://github.com/cinosh07/VA2SAJ-Magnetic-Loop-Controller/issues/2)<br>
-[Generic Radio Cat Control compatible](https://github.com/cinosh07/VA2SAJ-Magnetic-Loop-Controller/issues/3)<br>
-[Auto Multiple Antennas Switching Support](https://github.com/cinosh07/VA2SAJ-Magnetic-Loop-Controller/issues/6)<br>
-[Ham Radio Deluxe](https://github.com/cinosh07/VA2SAJ-Magnetic-Loop-Controller/issues/9) and [Rig Control API Server Compatible.](https://github.com/cinosh07/VA2SAJ-Magnetic-Loop-Controller/issues/6) (Arduino Due or Teensy) This will allow the tuner to control any radio, regardless of the brand or communication protocol. Allowing to switch radio seamlessly for multiple radios/antennas environment with the tuner.<br>
-[Memories backed up on the cloud](https://github.com/cinosh07/VA2SAJ-Magnetic-Loop-Controller/issues/9) (Arduino Due or Teensy)<br>
-[Cloud manageable](https://github.com/cinosh07/VA2SAJ-Magnetic-Loop-Controller/issues/7) (Arduino Due or Teensy)<br>
-[App manageable](https://github.com/cinosh07/VA2SAJ-Magnetic-Loop-Controller/issues/8) (Arduino Due or Teensy)<br>
-[Loftur Hardware Compatible](https://github.com/cinosh07/VA2SAJ-Magnetic-Loop-Controller/issues/10) To make this firmware compatible with [Loftur mag loop controller project](https://sites.google.com/site/lofturj/to-automatically-tune-a-magnetic-loop-antenna) with little modifications to the circuit (Teensy Compatible) <br>

I have created issues for each of those future features. Priorities will be putted on the most wanted features. Please thumbs up or comment the features you want to be released. You can access this by clicking on the future features links above.
